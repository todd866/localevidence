# Local operating points

A closed clinical-AI product bakes in one calibration and applies it everywhere;
its clearest symptom is over-investigation (recommending imaging far more widely
than a given setting's prevalence and resources warrant), with no way to dial it
back. But the safe operating point is **local**: it depends on the base rate and
the costs of the specific deployment node.

Each file here is one node's operating point — plain text, version-controllable,
inspectable. It sets:

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `base_rate` | prior probability of the dangerous condition in this node's population |
| `cost_fn` | relative harm of a **miss** (false negative) |
| `cost_fp` | relative harm/cost of **over-investigation** (false positive) |
| `resource_friction` | >1 if the investigation is scarce/costly here (raises the bar) |
| `escalate_threshold` | probability at/above which to escalate/treat outright |

The action is decided **by code**, not coaxed from a model — the standard decision
threshold (Pauker & Kassirer, NEJM 1975):

```
investigate when  prob >= cost_fp * friction / (cost_fp * friction + cost_fn)
```

So the dial moves the recommendation **monotonically and reproducibly**. See it:

```bash
# same patient probability, two nodes -> different, locally-correct action
python3 -m localevidence operating-point \
    --config examples/operating_points/rural-gp.json \
    --config examples/operating_points/tertiary-ed.json \
    --prob 0.08
# rural-gp -> WATCH (high local bar); tertiary-ed -> INVESTIGATE (low local bar)
```

The model's job — estimating the probability — stays behind the capability gate.
The dial only governs the action *given* a probability. A badly-set local dial
confidently mis-targets; the value is that the setting is **explicit, bounded, and
auditable**, not that local is automatically better.
